My name is **Andriy Kryvtsun** (Ukrainian: *Андрій Кривцун*) but people often call me Andy (sometimes even Andrzej or Andre).

I wrote my first program in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) computer language in my school notebook with a 
regular pen in the late 80s as I didn't have access to a computer at that time. My first personal computing device was 
a Soviet programmable microcalculator [Elektronika MK-61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektronika_MK-61) and 
I recall with great pleasure weeks spent writing and launching programs on it (actually those programs were something 
between binary codes and [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) language).

Currently I’m a senior software engineer with over two decades of professional experience in the IT industry.

I’m definitely a [backend guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend#Backend_focused). My actual technical 
stack consists of JVM-based computer languages (mostly Java, but also Kotlin and Scala too) and related technologies 
(like Spring framework, Hibernate, JUnit etc.) but in beginning of my career there was a period when I worked as a 
system network administrator and even passed Oracle Database Administration exam.

I have experience working in product and service companies both in my home country Ukraine as well as abroad. 
I lived in the New York City area for over four years working onsite in a bank. Since then I have fallen in love with 
[street photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_photography) and hate the office dress code.

My professional interests lie in the field of software architectures, 
[Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD), [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) 
and creation of distributed systems.

I'm a [Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform](/files/scjp-cert.pdf) (SCJP)
