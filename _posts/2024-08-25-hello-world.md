title:  "Hello, World!"

During my work and personal life I constantly face tricky tasks and interesting facts about computers. Like all of us 
I don't have enough time to slow down and think it over during workdays. Thus, a few years ago I began taking quick 
notes so I wouldn't forget anything. Unfortunately, it didn't help and the information in those notes became outdated.

That’s why I’ve decided to launch my technical blog. I hope it’ll give me enough motivation to explore interesting 
information about computers more deeply and share it with others.

I’m going to write here about computer programming languages, operating systems (I'm mastering macOS now after 
switching from Windows), IT books I’ve read and, perhaps, about my home [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS423+).

Maybe I’ll even write about my beloved [French bulldog Yosya](https://www.instagram.com/josyafrench) who took part in 
my Internet meetings during my work from home and more than once interrupted them with his snoring — we’ll see…
